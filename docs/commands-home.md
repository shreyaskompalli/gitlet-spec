The Commands
------

We now go through each command you must support in detail. Remember that good
programmers always care about their data structures: as you read these commands,
you should think first about how you should store your data to easily support
these commands and second about if there is any opportunity to reuse commands
that you've already implemented (hint: there is ample opportunity in this
project to reuse code you've already written).

The commands that you'll need to implement are each listed on their own tab: click
the "The Commands" drop down on the left to view details for each one.
