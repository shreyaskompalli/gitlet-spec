Listed below are many high quality resources compiled across multiple semesters to help you get started/unstuck on Gitlet.
These videos and resources will be linked in the relevant portions of the spec, but they are here as well for your
convenience. More resources may be created throughout the duration of the project as needed; if so, they will be linked here as well.

- Git Intros: These should mostly be review at this point since you have been using Git throughout the semester, but it is
_vital_ that you have a strong understanding of Git itself before trying to implement Gitlet. Be sure you understand the contents
of these videos thoroughly before proceeding.
