There are two extra credit opportunities available to you in this project, both
of which involve implementing additional commands in Gitlet that exist in real-life
Git. The first opportunity revolves around the `remote` commands, which allow
collaboration by multiple people to one repository. The second opportunity asks you
to implement the `diff` command, which shows differences in various files when comparing
between various points in the repository (between two branch heads, the most recent commit
and the current working directory, etc.).

To save you from yourselves, we will only give credit for one of the two extra credit features,
and will ignore the other. Of course, you can do both nevertheless (out of the sheer joy
of programming), but don't expect any *extra* extra credit as a result.
