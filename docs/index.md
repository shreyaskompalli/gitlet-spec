Project 3: Gitlet
----
Welcome to Gitlet, the final project of the semester! The following spec is incredibly long and detailed;
it's easily the most nuanced project that you'll work on in this class. However, *all* of the information
in this spec is here for a reason. Though you may not get through all of this info on the first, second, or
even third read-throughs, please keep revisiting the various tabs on the left as you progress through the project.
You'll often find the answers to your questions tucked away in some section of this spec, so it behooves you to
refer to this document before relying on a Piazza, Gitbug, or office hours response (as generations of
students have learned the hard way).

Lastly, while this project may seem quite daunting and intense, it's one of the most rewarding parts of the
CS61B experience! Students have said as much for years; the lessons and techniques that you learn from completing
this project will help you immensely in future projects, courses, and even jobs. So, without further ado, let's get
started!
